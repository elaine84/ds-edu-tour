## A guided tour of UC Berkeley's data science education program

* This document compiles information distributed across many web pages and GitHub repositories involved in running a live suite of data science courses.
* These valuable resources -- designed for and by Cal students, instructors, and others supporting classes at Cal -- are publicly available.
* This content should be of broad interest to diverse folks thinking about data science education, using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom, and/or deploying and scaling JupyterHub.

**Keywords: data science, UC Berkeley, undergraduate education, Jupyter notebooks, JupyterHub deployment**

### Who is this for?
* Designed for anyone who wants to learn about Cal's data science program but doesn't have an account on [data8.berkeley.edu](https://data8.berkeley.edu/).
* This snapshot is for folks at [JupyterDays Boston 2016](http://blog.jupyter.org/2016/02/16/jupyterdays-boston-2016/) (March 17-18, 2016 in Cambridge, MA) -- hopefully, this will give you plenty of materials to explore, fork, and hack on during Friday's coding and projects session.

### What will you find here?
* An overview of UC Berkeley's new data science education program.
* Pointers to current course materials distributed as Jupyter notebooks.
* An overview of the live JupyterHub-based infrastructure.

## JupyterHub deployment

    git clone https://github.com/data-8/jupyterhub-deploy.git

* The [JupyterHub deployment for DATA 8](https://github.com/data-8/jupyterhub-deploy) is based on [Jessica Hamrick](http://www.jesshamrick.com/)'s [jupyterhub-compmodels-deploy](https://github.com/compmodels/jupyterhub-deploy) for a UC Berkeley course, Computational Models of Cognition (COGSCI 131).

* See Jessica's blog post at Rackspace on [Deploying JupyterHub for Education](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/deploying-jupyterhub-for-education/) and also her README at [jupyterhub-compmodels-deploy](https://github.com/compmodels/jupyterhub-deploy).

# ds-edu-tour

This README provides a guided tour of UC Berkeley's data science education program.
It compiles information distributed across many web pages and GitHub repositories involved in running a live suite of data science courses.
These valuable resources -- originally designed for and by Cal students, instructors, and others supporting classes at Cal -- are publicly available, and should be of broad interest to folks thinking about data science education, using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom, and/or deploying and scaling JupyterHub.

**Keywords**
Data science, UC Berkeley, undergraduate education, Jupyter notebooks, JupyterHub deployment

# A guided tour of UC Berkeley's data science education program

* This README provides a guided tour of the University of California, Berkeley's data science education program.

* It compiles information distributed across many web pages and GitHub repositories involved in running a live suite of data science courses.

* These valuable resources -- designed for and by Cal students, instructors, and others supporting classes at Cal -- are publicly available.

* This content should be of broad interest to diverse folks thinking about data science education, using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom, and/or deploying and scaling JupyterHub.

**Keywords: Data science, UC Berkeley, undergraduate education, Jupyter notebooks, JupyterHub deployment**
